## Divide and Conquer
- Divide and Conquer is a very powerful technique for solving computational problems.
- The Divide and Conquer strategy takes a problem and breaks it down into multiple sub-problems, which are then collected to solve the original problem.
- Divide and Conquer algorithms are often implemented using recursion.


### Steps of Divide and Conquer
- **Divide**: break the original problem into sub problems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size.
- **Conquer**: Solve the sub-problems
- **Combine**: Combine the solutions to create a solution to the original problem.

### Examples of Divide and Conquer
- Quick sort
- Merge Sort
- Integer Multiplication
- Matrix Multiplication (Strassen's Algorithm)
- Maximal Subsequence

### Advantages of Divide and Conquer
- It enables us to solve difficult problems.
- It often produces efficient solutions.
- We can leverage parallelism, as sub-problems can be solved simultaneously.

### Disadvantages of Divide and Conquer
- It can be slow.
- It can run into problems with space complexity.
- It can be hard to implement.
