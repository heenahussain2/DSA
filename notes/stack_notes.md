## Stack Data Structure

### Overview
- Stack data structure is used to add or remove items one at a time.
- It is a LIFO data structure - Last in First Out
- The last element to be added is the first one to be removed.

### Stack Operations
Common stack operations are:
- Push (item): Add an item to the top of the stack
- Pop (item): remove and return the top item
- Peek (item): return the top item without removing it.
- is_empty (item) : return true if the stack is empty

### Applications of Stack
- Reverse polish notation for evaluating Arithmetic expressions
- Syntax parsing
- Cold stack: space for parameters and local variables is created.
- Used in recursion
- Undo and redo operations in word processors
- Low level assembly programming.
