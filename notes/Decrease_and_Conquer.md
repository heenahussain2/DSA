## Decrease and Conquer
- It is a computational problem-solving technique which takes a problem and reduces it to a smaller problem, which is easier to solve.
- It is also confused with divide and conquer, which breaks a problem into multiple smaller problems.
- Decrease and conquer focuses on reducing the problem size to a smaller size of the same problem at each step or incrementally, until a solution is found or is not possible.


### Categories for decreasing problem size
- There are different categories of amounts that an original problem can be decreased by in a decrease and conquer algorithm.
    #### Decrease by a Constant
    - This is often a constant of one.
    - Examples include - insertion sort and graph search algorithms such as DFS and BFS
    
    #### Decrease by a constant Factor
    - Most commonly by a factor of two.
    - Examples include Binary search, Fake-coin detection problems and "Russian peasant multiplication"

    #### Variable - size decrease
    - A classic example here would be Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of 2 integers, where the amount of decrease depends on the values given.


### Examples
- Binary Search
- Euclid's Algorithm
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Insertion sort
- Selection Sort
