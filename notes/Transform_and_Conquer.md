## Transform and Conquer
Transform and conquer is an approach to problem solving that is based on the idea of modifying the original problem, thats is more amenable to solution or easier to solve.


### Types of Transform and Conquer
- **Instance Simplification** - The instances of the problem can be transformed into easier instances to solve.
- **Representation Change** - The data structure can be transformed so that it is more efficient.
- **Problem Reduction** - The problem can be transformed into an easier problem to solve.


### Examples of Transform and Conquer
- Heap Sort
- Determining Element Uniqueness
- Solving Systems of Linear Equations (Gaussian Elimination)
- Many geometrical problems.
- Graph algorithms that make use of topological sort.
